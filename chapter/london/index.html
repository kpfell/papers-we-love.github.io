          <p>Andy Bennett on "Scalable Atomic Visibility with RAMP Transactions"</p> <p> </p> <p>Bailis et al formalise "Read Atomic" isolation which is a database isolation level sufficient for many applications which make use of large,distributed databases in real world applications. They then show how to design a database system which provides this isolation level whilst allowing read, write and read/write transactions on data across multiple partitions: partitions which do not need to communicate with each other.This method is both performant and fairly portable to existing architectures and allows database authors to implement much stronger guarantees than are currently available from systems in use at companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Yahoo or Amazon.</p> <p> </p> <p>In this talk we will explore the contributions of this paper and how they can be used solve some of the anomolies encountered in today's multi-node, distributed, database systems and accompanying applications.</p> <p> </p>… <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-London/events/221535320/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Relational programming, or logic programming, is a programming paradigm that exhibits remarkable and powerful properties, to the extent that its implementation seems frightfully daunting to the layman. µKanren is a minimal relational language that seeks to strip the paradigm down to its core, leaving us with a succinct, elegant and above all <i>simple</i> set of primitives on top of which we can rebuild even the most powerful relational constructs.</p> <p>In this talk, we will explore the µKanren language by implementing it from first principles in a simple functional programming language, going on to demonstrate how you can assemble these simple building blocks into a semblance of its richer parent, miniKanren, and maybe solve a logic puzzle or two to make sure it’s working as advertised.</p> <p>The µKanren paper, and the original µKanren implementation, were authored by Jason Hemann and Daniel P. Friedman. The paper is available at </p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-London/events/220542230/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Many modern statistics and machine learning problems can be recast as optimization problems where we look to minimize a convex objective function.</p> <p>The resulting objective function enforces a set of desirable properties which we wish our answer to possess: a popular example would be sparsity (i.e., we wish to obtain a sparse answer for reasons of interpretability or for other reasons).</p> <p>However, it is often the case that minimizing such objective functions is difficult.

          <p><b>Equal Rights for Functional Objects, or, The More Things Change, the More they Stay the Same</b></p> <p>There are many ways of defining equality, particularly in a language which has both object-oriented and functional aspects. There's reference equality, numerical equality, shallow list equality, deep list equality, string equality, and even "fuzzy" floating-point equality. Which is the right to choose in any given situation? Which should i use for my equals() method on my custom object?</p> <p>This paper answers all of these questions, by taking a seemingly complex problem and revealing an underlying simplicity. It does this by defining one equality operation that works in any situation.</p> <p>The paper makes use of lisp syntax, but the ideas are applicable to most modern languages.</p> <p>
